I am a graduate student at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science. I am a member of [Parallel Computing and Data Intelligence (ParInt) lab](https://www.cs.utsa.edu/~sprasad/parint_lab/), where I work on research projects related to Parallel algorithms, Cryptographic algorithms, Machine Learning and Data Intensive Computing. I also work as a Grader for the Computer Science Department at UTSA.
